## Key Insights

### 1. **Volume Size Performance Regimes**
```
Small Volumes (< 1M voxels):    PBA wins consistently (2x faster)
Medium Volumes (10-20M voxels): Performance varies, close competition  
Large Volumes (> 100M voxels):  PBA wins significantly (2.6x faster)
```

### 2. **Performance Variability at 256³**
The 256³ volume shows **significant performance variation**:
- Run 1: CUDA 2x faster (PBA: 16.677ms, CUDA: 8.312ms)
- Run 2: PBA 1.3x faster (PBA: 6.250ms, CUDA: 8.221ms)  
- Run 3: CUDA 1.3x faster (PBA: 10.656ms, CUDA: 7.989ms)

**Possible causes:**
- GPU thermal/boost state differences
- Memory allocation patterns
- Cache effects
- Random boundary point distribution effects

### 3. **Scaling Characteristics**

**PBA Scaling:**
- 64³ → 256³: ~8-14x time increase for 64x volume increase ✅ Sub-linear
- 256³ → 512³: ~1.7-3x time increase for 8x volume increase ✅ Excellent scaling

**CUDA EDT Scaling:**  
- 64³ → 256³: ~5-6x time increase for 64x volume increase ✅ Very good
- 256³ → 512³: ~6x time increase for 8x volume increase ❌ Less efficient

### 4. **Algorithm Efficiency Analysis**

**PBA Advantages:**
- ✅ Excellent scaling for very large volumes (512³+)
- ✅ Good performance for small volumes (64³)
- ✅ Highly parallel architecture utilization

**PBA Disadvantages:**
- ❌ Performance variability at medium volumes (256³)
- ❌ Overhead from padding/texture requirements
- ❌ Complex memory management

**Traditional CUDA EDT Advantages:**
- ✅ Consistent performance across runs
- ✅ Good efficiency at medium volumes (256³)
- ✅ Simpler memory management

**Traditional CUDA EDT Disadvantages:**
- ❌ Poor scaling to very large volumes (512³+)
- ❌ Slower on small volumes (64³)

## Recommendations

### When to Use PBA:
1. **Large volumes (512³+)**: Clear winner with 2.6x speedup
2. **Small volumes (< 64³)**: Consistent 2x speedup
3. **Batch processing**: Where GPU can stay warm

### When to Use Traditional CUDA EDT:
1. **Medium volumes (256³)**: More consistent performance
2. **Single computations**: Where setup overhead matters  
3. **Memory-constrained environments**: Lower memory overhead

### Volume Size Guidelines:
- **< 100K voxels**: Use PBA (2x faster)
- **1M-20M voxels**: Test both, choose based on consistency needs
- **> 100M voxels**: Use PBA (2.6x faster)

## Original EDT Times Answered:

**Your question: "what is the original edt's time"**

**Answer:** The original CUDA EDT times are:
- **64³**: 1.471 ms
- **256³**: ~8.0 ms (consistent across runs)  
- **512³**: 46.981 ms

The PBA implementation provides significant speedups for large volumes but shows variability at medium sizes. The 256³ volume appears to be at a performance transition point where small factors can significantly affect which algorithm performs better.
